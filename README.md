# Envision

Envision is a small, easy to use Clojure library for data processing, cleanup
and visualisation. If you've heard about Incanter, you may see a couple of things
that we do in a similar way.

## Project Maturity

Envision is a relatively young project. Since it's never meant to be used in hard-
production (e.g. it will never be something user-facing), and is intended to be 
used by people who'd like to yield some information from their data, it should 
be stable enough from the very early releases.


## Dependency Information (Artifacts)

Envision artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/clojurewerkz/envision). If you are using Maven, add the following repository
definition to your `pom.xml`:

```xml

  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```

## Development

Envision uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against all supported Clojure versions using

```
lein2 all test
```

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all
tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
